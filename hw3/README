To run this program, navigate into the src directory and type make. This will
generate the "shaded" executable. This can then be run with the following args:

input file
xres
yres

Most of the logic for this assignment is in rotation.cpp. Some of it (the arcball
quaternion multiplication stuff) is in shaded.cpp. To see which methods I added
to shaded.cpp, just look at shaded.h. The only other major changes to shaded.cpp
from the OpenGL Demo were made in the mouse methods, in order to get the arcball
stuff working.
