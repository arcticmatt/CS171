     * transform 'C', then the Modelview Matrix is modified in the following

     *
     * M = I * T * R * S * C

     * computer is slow, OpenGL ends up rendering only part of the scene before
     * it displays it in the program window. The rest of the scene shows up a
     * second later. This effect is referred to as "flickering". You have most
     * likely experienced this sometime in your life when using a computer. It
     * is not the most visually appealing experience, right?
     *
     * To avoid the above situation, we need to tell OpenGL to display the
     * entire scene at once rather than rendering the scene one pixel at a
     * time. We do so by enabling "double buffering".
     *
     * Basically, double buffering is a technique where rendering is done using
     * two pixel grids of RGB values. One pixel grid is designated as the
     * "active buffer" while the other is designated as the "off-screen buffer".
     * Rendering is done on the off-screen buffer while the active buffer is
     * being displayed. Once the scene is fully rendered on the off-screen buffer,
     * the two buffers switch places so that the off-screen buffer becomes the
     * new active buffer and gets displayed while the old active buffer becomes
     * the new off-screen buffer. This process allows scenes to be fully rendered
     * onto the screen at once, avoiding the flickering effect.
     *
     * We actually enable double buffering in the 'main' function with the line:

       glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH);

     * ^ 'GLUT_DOUBLE' tells OpenGL to use double buffering. The other two
     * parameters, 'GLUT_RGB' and 'GLUT_DEPTH', tell OpenGL to initialize the
     * RGB pixel grids and the depth buffer respectively.

            /* The next few lines of code are how we tell OpenGL to render
             * geometry for us. First, let us look at the 'glVertexPointer'
             * function.
             *
             * 'glVertexPointer' tells OpenGL the specifications for our
             * "vertex array". As a recap of the comments from the 'Object'
             * struct, the "vertex array" stores all the faces of the surface
             * we want to render. The faces are stored in the array as
             * consecutive points. For instance, if our surface were a cube,
             * then our "vertex array" could be the following:
             *
             * [face1vertex1, face1vertex2, face1vertex3, face1vertex4,
             *  face2vertex1, face2vertex2, face2vertex3, face2vertex4,
             *  face3vertex1, face3vertex2, face3vertex3, face3vertex4,
             *  face4vertex1, face4vertex2, face4vertex3, face4vertex4,
             *  face5vertex1, face5vertex2, face5vertex3, face5vertex4,
             *  face6vertex1, face6vertex2, face6vertex3, face6vertex4]
             *
             * Obviously to us, some of the vertices in the array are repeats.
             * However, the repeats cannot be avoided since OpenGL requires
             * this explicit specification of the faces.
             *
             * The parameters to the 'glVertexPointer' function are as
             * follows:
             *
             * - int num_points_per_face: this is the parameter that tells
             *                            OpenGL where the breaks between
             *                            faces are in the vertex array.
             *                            Below, we set this parameter to 3,
             *                            which tells OpenGL to treat every
             *                            set of 3 consecutive vertices in
             *                            the vertex array as 1 face. So
             *                            here, our vertex array is an array
             *                            of triangle faces.
             *                            If we were using the example vertex
             *                            array above, we would have set this
             *                            parameter to 4 instead of 3.
             * - enum type_of_coordinates: this parameter tells OpenGL whether
             *                             our vertex coordinates are ints,
             *                             floats, doubles, etc. In our case,
             *                             we are using floats, hence 'GL_FLOAT'.
             * - sizei stride: this parameter specifies the number of bytes
             *                 between consecutive vertices in the array.
             *                 Most often, you will set this parameter to 0
             *                 (i.e. no offset between consecutive vertices).
             * - void* pointer_to_array: this parameter is the pointer to
             *                           our vertex array.
