All the relevant code is contained in Assignment.cpp and Assignment.hpp. I tried
to implement the Phong shading part but didn't get it working. Right now I just
send out rays from the camera and see if they intersect with one if the superquadrics -
if they do, I color the pixel red, else, I color the pixel white. This functionality
isn't quite working. I tried.

Happy holidays.
