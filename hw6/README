INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN CODE

1. Single Pendulum

Simply type make and run the executable with the arguments specified in
the assignment.

2. Double pendulum.

Simply type make and run the executable with the arguments specified in the
assignment.

3. Elastic

Simply type make and run the executable with the arguments specified in the
assignment.

4. I_Bar

Simply type make and run the executable with the arguments specified in the
assignment.

Use the 's' key to advance the frame. The frame number is outputted to the
terminal. Use the 'q' key to quit the program.

5. Bunny

First, create an empty directory called 'output' in the 'Bunny_Frames' directory.
The relative path 'Bunny_Frames/output/' should now exist. Now, type make
and run the executable with NO arguments. The .obj files should now be in the
output directory. All the vertices are given to 6 decimal points of precision.
This causes some differences when diffing with the correct files, but comparing
by eye shows that they are the same (ignoring floating point errors).
