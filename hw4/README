To run the code for part 1, navigate into the src directory and type make. This
will generate the "glslRenderer" executable. This can be run with the following
args:

input file
xres
yres
mode

Most of the logic for this part is in the two shaders. The only other thing I
really did was add readShaders into my shaded.cpp file.

To run the code for part 2, navigate into the src2 directory and type make. This
will generate the "glslRenderer" executable. This can be run with the following
args:

color texture file
normal map file

Again, most of the logic for this part is in the two shaders. The main changes
I made to shaded.cpp are as follows:

- Add initGL() method that hardcodes lights (replace old init() method from hw3)
- Add readShaders()
- Add display() method that hardcodes square (replace old display() method from hw3)
