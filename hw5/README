To run the code, navigate into the src directory and type make. This will generate
the "shaded" executable. This can be run with the following args:

input file
xres
yres
h (time step)

The input files are located in the data directory.

Most of the logic for this assignment is contained in the framework.h file. More
specifically, most of the logic is written into new functions of the Scene struct.
I use functions of the Scene to compute the normal vectors, compute the matrix
operator, solve for the new vertices, etc. Basically, just look at the Scene
struct for the code.

================================================================================

Here is how I built F. Let c = cot(alpha) + cot(beta). We can rewrite the sum
in the discrete Laplacian as follows:

(sum c_j x_j) - (x_i sum c_j)

So then, for a given row in our F matrix, each column will have the value of
c_j, unless it is on the diagonal; then it will have the value of -(sum c_j).
This is, of course, ignoring, the h / 2A and identity matrix. But to add this
in, we just multiply the F matrix we just described by h / 2A (we have a different
A per row, because A is the sum of the faces surrounding a vertex) and then
subtract the resulting matrix from the identity matrix.
