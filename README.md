So it's like this. You're sitting there, just reading some Sylvia Plath, Kathleen Fraser. Or maybe The Little Prince. You know, just some quality literature. And some quote *flashes* in front of your eyes. Perhaps it's Plath: **"let me live, love, and code extremely beautiful spheres on reflective tables"**. 

Or maybe it's Saint-Exup√©ry: **"One sees clearly only after spending hours debugging. Anything essential is invisible when you actually want to see it."** 

And then you realize: **"Hm. Maybe I should go fix that bug."**
