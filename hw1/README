================================================================================
This README contains instructions on how to compile and execute my programs.
================================================================================

To compile and run my hw1, just navigate into the hw1/src directory and run make.
Then just run the wireframe executable
(e.g. ./wireframe ../data/scene_cube1.txt 800 800 | display -)

Part 1 is in parser.cpp
Parts 2-4 are in transformer.cpp
Parts 5-6 are in rasterizer.cpp and wireframe.cpp

An explanaation for the generalization of Bresenham's is in the comments
of rasterizer.cpp.
