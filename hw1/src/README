Part 1: Parse the scene description file and put the data into appropriate C++
data structures.

The parse_scene() function in parser.cpp handles this functionality. It goes through
a file formatted as specified in the assignment, and puts all the relevant information
into a scene struct (defined in parser.h). This includes the camera position and orientation,
the perspective parameters, and a vector of objects.
