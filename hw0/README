================================================================================
This README contains instructions on how to compile and execute my programs.
================================================================================

In each PartX folder, there is a Makefile. For Parts 1, 2, and 4, all you have
to do is run "make" and then run the generated executable with the correct
arguments. For Part 3, "make" needs to have been run in Parts 1 and 2 in order
to generate the necessary .o files.

For Part1, the executable takes an arbitrary number of .obj files.
For Part2, the executable takes a single text file containing a list of
translation, rotation, and scaling vectors.
For Part3, the executable takes a single text file with our specified object
and translation file format.
For Part4, the executable takes 2 numbers, xres and yres.

Note: All the executables are named main. All these contain are the main method.
Most of the logic is in the other cpp files. For the parts, these are
obj_reader, matrix_math, file_reader, and ppm_gen, respectively.
